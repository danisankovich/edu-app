Start Server:
run gulp to transpile typescript and scss, and to run server. Port 3000


Generate Components:
In order to ensure consistency between developers, make sure to build components
for Angular2 using the component generator. From project root, run the following command
> node generator/component.generator.js --selector=selectorName --componentName=componentName --fileName=fileName

we will build and improve the template as needed, and as the app progresses
